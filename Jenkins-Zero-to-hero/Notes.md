# Understanding Jenkins Pipelines
Before we dive in, let’s clarify some key concepts:

- Pipeline: A pipeline in Jenkins is a sequence of steps or jobs linked together to automate the build, test, and deploy processes.

- Declarative Pipeline: This is a more recent and advanced implementation of pipelines as code. It uses a simplified and more structured syntax, making it easier to write and understand.

- Scripted Pipeline: The original implementation of pipelines in Jenkins, using a general-purpose DSL built with Groovy. While powerful, it’s more complex and less user-friendly compared to Declarative Pipelines.

# Why Use a Pipeline?
A Jenkins Pipeline is defined in a Jenkinsfile, which can be versioned and reviewed like any other code. This approach, known as "Pipeline-as-Code," provides several benefits:

Automatic Pipeline Creation: Pipelines are created for all branches and pull requests automatically.

Code Review: Your pipeline code can be reviewed and iterated upon alongside your application code.

























# Understanding CI/CD
- Continuous Integration (CI): CI is a practice where developers frequently commit code changes into a shared repository. This code is then automatically built and tested to identify and fix bugs early. The goal of CI is to ensure that code changes are integrated smoothly, improve software quality, and expedite the release of new features.

- Continuous Delivery (CD): CD builds on CI by ensuring that the software can be reliably and quickly released to users. It involves running comprehensive tests in a staging environment that mirrors production to catch any issues before deployment. CD automates the release process, making the software deployment more efficient and reducing the risk of errors in production.

# What Is a Build Job in Jenkins?
- Fetching Dependencies: Automatically retrieving necessary libraries or packages.

- Compiling Code: Transforming source code into executable programs.

- Running Tests: Executing tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

- Deploying Applications: Publishing the application to different environments.

# Jenkins offers several types of build jobs, including:

- Freestyle Projects: Simple and flexible, allowing various configurations and integrations.

- Pipelines: Advanced setups using DSL (Domain-Specific Language) scripts for complex workflows.

- Multi-Configuration Projects: Jobs that run with different configurations to test various scenarios.

- Multibranch Pipelines: Automatically manage branches in a repository, making it easier to handle multiple feature branches.

- Organization Folders: Manage projects in a folder structure for better organization and scalability.

# Task-01: Create a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline
1. Create a New Pipeline Job

    - Open Jenkins and click on "New Item."

    - Select "Pipeline" and give your job a descriptive name.

    - Click "OK" to proceed to the job configuration page.

2. Configure the Pipeline

    - In the job configuration, scroll down to the "Pipeline" section.

    - For the "Definition" field, select "Pipeline script."

    - In the "Script" field, enter the following Declarative Pipeline syntax:

    ```Dockerfile
      pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
          stage('Build') {
              steps {
                  echo 'Building...'
              }
          }
          stage('Test') {
              steps {
                  echo 'Testing...'
              }
          }
          stage('Deploy') {
              steps {
                  echo 'Deploying...'
              }
          }
      }
  }
```
   - This script defines a simple pipeline with three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy. Each stage currently includes a placeholder step that outputs a message.

3. Run the Pipeline

    - Save your pipeline configuration.

    - Click "Build Now" to trigger the pipeline.
